4 Levels of Testing

1.  **Unit Testing** : checks if software components are fulfilling functionalities or not.
2.  **Integration Testing** : checks the data flow from one module to other modules.
3.  **System Testing** : evaluates both functional and non-functional needs for the testing.
4.  **Acceptance Testing** : checks the requirements of a specification or contract are met as per its delivery.
