# Java
---
- Strongly typed: every variable must be declared with a data type.
- Everything in Java is treated as an [[object]] and has accompanying features like [[class]], [[Encapsulation]], [[abstraction]], [[inheritance]], and [[polymorphism.]]
-  [Multithreading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/) **is supported by Java.** Large applications can be converted to multiple threads and executed simultaneously. This reduces the resources and time needed to execute a program.
