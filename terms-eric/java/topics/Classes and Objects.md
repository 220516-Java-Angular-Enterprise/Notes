# Classes and Objects

An object has three characteristics:

-   **State:** represents the data (value) of an object.
-   **Behavior:** represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
-   **Identity:** An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the [[JVM]] to identify each object uniquely.


A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
