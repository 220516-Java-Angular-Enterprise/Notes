# Difference between JSON and XML

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data-interchange format 
that is completely language independent. It is based on the JavaScript 
programming language and easy to understand and generate.

**XML (Extensible markup language)** was designed to carry data, not to display 
data. It is a W3C recommendation. **Extensible Markup Language (XML)** is a markup 
language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that 
is both human-readable and machine-readable. 

The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across 
the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for 
different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, 
the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data 
structures such as those used in web services.
