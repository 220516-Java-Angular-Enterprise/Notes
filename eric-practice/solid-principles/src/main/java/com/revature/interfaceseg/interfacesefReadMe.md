# What is Interface  Segregation

- Clients shouldnot be forced to implement uneccessary methods which they willnot use.
- interface  should have single responsibility
- Split interfaces into smaller and more specific features.

# Why

- Prevent Client from unnecessarily getting stuck in implementing unwanted methods.
