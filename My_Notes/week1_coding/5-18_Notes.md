## Exception
An unexpected event that happens in 
checked exception occur at compile time... won't compile. Checks your code and will check 
errors are breaking your code and won't compile at all
Exceptions disrupt your flow
Throwables break off into 2 either errors or exceptions. 

Try.. is trying your code to see if you have an exception
Catch.. is catching any exception in your code. 

Every class we make is a subclass of object.
You want to use the try-catch block to handle the exception. 
finally blocks will execute regardless if exception was thrown.

# Mult-try catch block.
After trys catch the first exception it goes straight to the exception. 
Once you get the red error and check exceptions. 


## Abstraction
Is data hiding. 
Abstraction always uses inheritance. 

# abstract vs. interface 
A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword "implements".
An abstraction class can be extended using the key word "extends".

An interface can extend another Java interface only, 
An abstract class 
## Inheritance
# Why do we want to use inheritance? 
Because we want to increase reusability for the code.

The lowest child would be private.
