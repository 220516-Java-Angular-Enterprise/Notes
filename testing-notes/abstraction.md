# Abstraction

 In Java, **Data Abstraction** is defined as the process of reducing the object to its essence so that only the necessary characteristics are exposed to the users.

Abstraction defines an object in terms of its properties (attributes), behavior (methods), and interfaces (means of communicating with other objects).

In Java, we can achieve Data Abstraction using [[Abstract Classes]] and [[Interfaces]].  
[[Interfaces]]. allow 100% abstraction (complete abstraction). Interfaces allow you to abstract the implementation completely.
