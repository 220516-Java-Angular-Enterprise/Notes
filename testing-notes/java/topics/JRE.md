# Java Runtime Environment

A Javaâ„¢ runtime environment (JRE) is a set of components to create and run a Java application. A JRE is part of a Java development kit (JDK).

A JRE is made up of a Java virtual machine (JVM), Java class libraries, and the Java class loader. JDKs are used to develop Java software; JREs provide programming tools and deployment technologies; and JVMs execute Java programs.
