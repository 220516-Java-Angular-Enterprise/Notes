| 1)  | StringBuffer is _synchronized_ i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously. | StringBuilder is _non-synchronized_ i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously. |
| 2)  | StringBuffer is _less efficient_ than StringBuilder.                                                                         | StringBuilder is _more efficient_ than StringBuffer.                                                                                 |
