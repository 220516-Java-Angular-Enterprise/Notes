Fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming.

Restricting the direct access of the state and behaviors of a class. This is done in Java by using the private [[Access Modifiers]]. 

The Main benefit of encapsulation is hiding data. This is good because users do not need to know how the class is implemented or stored. It is also useful because it protect the user for changing the variables. This is done by the use of getter and setter methods. Getter methods are methods that return the attributes and setter methods are methods that change the state of the Object.
