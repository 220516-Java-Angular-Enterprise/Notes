This _class_ file is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine for the underlying platform. The same _class_ file can be executed on any version of JVM running on any platform and operating system.

_Similar to virtual machines,_ the JVM creates an isolated space on a host machine. This space can be used to execute Java programs irrespective of the platform or operating system of the machine.

The JVM consists of three distinct components:

1.  Class Loader
2.  Runtime Memory/Data Area
3.  Execution Engine
