Three main types of dependency injection
1. Construtor Injection
	- Constructor based DI occurs when a class's constructor is called upon with arguments that represents the injected dependency.
2. Setter Injection
	- Utilizing setter methods on the Spring Beans with a no argument constructor for dependency injection
3. Field (property based injection)
	- Utilizing the fields a class and the @Autowired annotation for dependency injection.
