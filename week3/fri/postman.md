# Postman

Postman is one of the most popular software testing tools which is used for API 
testing. With the help of this tool, developers can easily create, test, share, and 
document APIs.

* Postman is a standalone software testing API (Application Programming Interface) 
platform to build, test, design, modify, and document APIs. It is a simple Graphic 
User Interface for sending and viewing HTTP requests and responses.


* While using Postman, for testing purposes, one doesn't need to write any HTTP client 
network code. Instead, we build test suites called collections and let Postman interact 
with the API.


* In this tool, nearly any functionality that any developer may need is embedded. 
This tool has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, 
PUT, PATCH, and convert the API to code for languages like JavaScript and Python.

## Why Use Postman?

Postman is based on a wide range of extremely user-friendly power tools. For more 
than 8 million users, Postman has become a tool of convenience. Following are the 
reasons why Postman is used:

* **Accessibility**- One can use it anywhere after installing Postman into the device by simply logging in to the account.


* **Use Collections**-Postman allows users to build collections for their API-calls. Every set can create multiple requests and subfolders. It will help to organize the test suites.


* **Test development**- To test checkpoints, verification of successful HTTP response status shall be added to every API- calls.


* **Automation Testing**-Tests can be performed in several repetitions or iterations by using the Collection Runner or Newman, which saves time for repeated tests.


* **Creating Environments**- The design of multiple environments results in less replication of tests as one can use the same collection but for a different setting.


* **Debugging**- To effectively debug the tests, the postman console helps to track what data is being retrieved.


* **Collaboration**- You can import or export collections and environments to enhance the sharing of files. You may also use a direct connection to share the collections.


* **Continuous integration**-It can support continuous integration.
