## Logging Levels

| Level   | 	Description                                                                                               |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ALL`   | 	All levels including custom levels.                                                                       |
| `DEBUG` | 	Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.                |
| `INFO`  | 	Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level. |
| `WARN`  | 	Designates potentially harmful situations.                                                                |
| `ERROR` | 	Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.                       |
| `FATAL` | 	Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.                   |
| `OFF`   | 	The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.                                            |
| `TRACE` | 	Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.                                             |
