# Junction/Intersection Tables
Many-to-many relationships between tables are accommodated in 
databases by means of junction tables. A junction table contains 
the primary key columns of the two tables you want to relate. 
You then create a relationship from the primary key columns of 
each of those two tables to the matching columns in the junction 
table.
