# What is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)?

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of 
entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is 
an object, a component of data. An entity set is a collection of 
similar entities. These entities can have attributes that 
define its properties.

By defining the entities, their attributes, and showing the 
relationships between them, an ER diagram illustrates the 
logical structure of databases.

ER diagrams are used to sketch out the design of a database.
There are two reasons to create a database diagram. You're either 
designing a new schema or you need to document your existing 
structure.
