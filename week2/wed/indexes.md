# Indexes

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to 
speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. 
An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book.

For example, if you want to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, 
you first refer to the index, which lists all the topics alphabetically and are then 
referred to one or more specific page numbers.

An index helps to speed up `SELECT` queries and `WHERE` clauses, but it slows down data 
input, with the `UPDATE` and the `INSERT` statements. Indexes can be created or dropped 
with no effect on the data.

Creating an index involves the `CREATE INDEX` statement, which allows you to name 
the index, to specify the table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate 
whether the index is in an ascending or descending order.

Indexes can also be unique, like the `UNIQUE` constraint, in that the index prevents 
duplicate entries in the column or combination of columns on which there is an index.

## The `CREATE INDEX` Command
The basic syntax of a `CREATE INDEX` is as follows.

`CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;`

### Single-Column Indexes
A single-column index is created based on only one table column. 
The basic syntax is as follows.

````
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);
````

### Unique Indexes
Unique indexes are used not only for performance, but also for data integrity. 
A unique index does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table. 
The basic syntax is as follows.
````
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
on table_name (column_name);
````

### Composite Indexes
A composite index is an index on two or more columns of a table. Its basic syntax 
is as follows.

````
CREATE INDEX index_name
on table_name (column1, column2);
````
Whether to create a single-column index or a composite index, take into consideration 
the column(s) that you may use very frequently in a query's `WHERE` clause as filter 
conditions.

Should there be only one column used, a single-column index should be the choice. 
Should there be two or more columns that are frequently used in the `WHERE` clause as 
filters, the composite index would be the best choice.

### Implicit Indexes
Implicit indexes are indexes that are automatically created by the database server 
when an object is created. Indexes are automatically created for primary key constraints 
and unique constraints.

## The `DROP INDEX` Command
An index can be dropped using SQL `DROP` command. Care should be taken when dropping an 
index because the performance may either slow down or improve.

The basic syntax is as follows −

`DROP INDEX index_name;`

## When should indexes be avoided?

Although indexes are intended to enhance a database's performance, 
there are times when they should be avoided.

The following guidelines indicate when the use of an index should be reconsidered.

* Indexes should not be used on small tables.

* Tables that have frequent, large batch updates or insert operations.

* Indexes should not be used on columns that contain a high number of NULL values.

* Columns that are frequently manipulated should not be indexed.
