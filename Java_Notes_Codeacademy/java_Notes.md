### Print Statements
# System
A built-in Java class that contains useful tools for our programs.
# out 
is short for "output"
# println 
is short for "print line".
## Compilation:Catching Errors
-Java is a compiled programming language meaning the code we write in java is transformed into byte code by a compiler.
-Compilers translate human-friendly programming into other programming languages that computers execute.

## Compilation: Creating Executables

-Compilation helped us catch an error. 
- The terminal with the command: 
javac Compiling.java
-this command if successfully compiled produces an executable class: FileName.class.
After creating that file we use : java FileName to execute everything.

## The Program
public class HelloWorld{
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
}
Java is a case-sensitive language.
# Classes
- public class HelloWorld {
//class code 
}
 All programs are made up of at least one class. 
- The class name must match the file
- Java variables and methods are named in a similar style called "camelCase"
# Methods 
public static void main(String[]args){
// Statements
}
Every Java program must have a method called main().
Methods are a sequence of tasks for the computer to execute.
This main() method holds all the instructions for our program.

# Statements
System.out.println("Hello World");
The line of code is a statement because it performs a single task. 
Statements always conclude with a semicolon.
