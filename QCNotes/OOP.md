# Object  Oriented Programming


### Classes and Objects:
    Classes: A user defined blueprint from which objects are created. It
    represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects
    of one type.

    Objects: It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents 
    the real life entities.  A typical Java program creates many objects, 
    which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of : 

    State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the 
    properties of an object.
    Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the 
    response of an object with other objects.
    Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to 
    interact with other objects.
    

### Encapsulation
    Organizing and protecting data/variables under a single unit.
    This prevents data/variables from being accessed/manipulated 
    outside of the unit. This is done by setting access modifiers 
    when initializing variables and methods.
    Private Attributes but Public Accessors and Mutators (Getters and Setters)
