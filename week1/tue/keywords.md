# Non Access Modifiers in Java

Non-access modifiers provide information about the characteristics of a class, 
method, or variable to the JVM. Seven types of Non-Access modifiers are present in Java.

## 1. `static`

The `static` keyword means that the entity to which it is applied is available 
outside any particular instance of the class. That means the static methods 
or the attributes are a part of the class and not an object. The memory is 
allocated to such an attribute or method at the time of class loading. The 
use of a `static` modifier makes the program more efficient by saving memory. 
A static field exists across all the class instances, and without creating 
an object of the class, they can be called.

## 2. `final`

The `final` keyword indicates that the specific class cannot be extended or a method
cannot be overwritten.

## 3. `abstract`

`abstract` keyword is used to declare a class as partially implemented means 
an object cannot be created directly from that class. Any subclass needs 
to be either implement all the methods of the abstract class, or it should 
also need to be an abstract class. The `abstract` keyword cannot be used with 
static, final, or private keywords because they prevent overriding, and we 
need to override methods in the case of an abstract class.

## 4. `synchronized`

`synchronized` keyword prevents a block of code from executing by multiple 
threads at once. It is very important for some critical operations.

## 5. `volatile`

The `volatile` keyword is used to make the class thread-safe. That means if 
a variable is declared as `volatile`, then that can be modified by multiple 
threads at the same time without any issues. The `volatile` keyword is only 
applicable to a variable. A volatile keyword reduces the chance of memory 
inconsistency. The value of a volatile variable is always read from the main 
memory and not from the local thread cache, and it helps to improve thread 
performance.

## 6. `transient`

The `transient` keyword may be applied to member variables of a class to 
indicate that the member variable should not be serialized when the containing 
class instance is serialized. Serialization is the process of converting 
an object into a byte stream. When we do not want to serialize the value 
of a variable, then we declare it as `transient`. To make it more transparent, 
letâ€™s take an example of an application where we need to accept UserID and 
Password. At that moment, we need to declare some variable to take the input 
and store the data, but as the data is susceptible, so we do not want to keep 
it stored after the job is done. To achieve this, we can use the `transient` 
keyword for variable declaration. That particular variable will not participate 
in the serialization process, and when we deserialize that, we will receive 
the default value of the variable.

## 7. `native`

The `native` keyword may be applied to a method to indicate that the method 
is implemented in a language other than Java. Using this java application 
can call code written in C, C++, or assembler language. A shared code 
library or DLL is required in this case.
