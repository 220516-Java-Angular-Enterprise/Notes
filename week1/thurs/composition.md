# Composition in Java

Composition is a design technique in java to implement a has-a relationship. 
Java Inheritance is used for code reuse purposes and we can do the same by using composition. 
Composition is achieved by using an instance variable that refers to other objects. If an object 
contains the other object and the contained object cannot exist without the existence of that object, 
then it is called composition. In more specific words composition is a way of describing reference between two or 
more classes using an instance variable and an instance should be created before it is used.

The benefits of using Composition is as follows:

* Composition allows the reuse of code.


* Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances but by using 
composition we can achieve it.


* Composition offers better test-ability of a class.


* By using composition, we are flexible enough to replace 
the implementation of a composed class with a better and 
improved version.


* By using composition, we can also change the member objects 
at run time, to dynamically change the behaviour of your program.

Do remember the certain key points of composition in java 
which are as follows:

* It represents a has-a relationship.


* In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.


* When there is a composition between two entities, the 
composed object cannot exist without the other entity. 
For example, A library can have no. of books on the same or 
different subjects. So, If the Library gets destroyed then 
All books within that particular library will be destroyed. 
his is because books can not exist without a library.


* The composition is achieved by using an instance variable 
that refers to other objects.


* We have to favour Composition over Inheritance.


Now let us finally refer to the below image in order 
to get a faint hint about the aggregation and to better 
understand how the composition works, let us take an 
example of the real-time library system.

```
// Java program to Illustrate Concept of Composition

// Importing required classes
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

// Class 1
// Helper class
// Book class
class Book {

	// Member variables of this class
	public String title;
	public String author;

	// Constructor of this class
	Book(String title, String author)
	{

		// This keyword refers top current instance
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
	}
}

// Class 2
// Helper class
// Library class contains list of books.
class Library {

	// Reference to refer to list of books.
	private final List<Book> books;

	// Constructor of this class
	Library(List<Book> books)
	{

		// This keyword refers to current instance itself
		this.books = books;
	}

	// Method of this class
	// Getting the list of books
	public List<Book> getListOfBooksInLibrary()
	{
		return books;
	}
}

// Class 3
// Main class
class GFG {

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		// Creating the objects of class 1 (Book class)
		// inside main() method
		Book b1
			= new Book("EffectiveJ Java", "Joshua Bloch");
		Book b2
			= new Book("Thinking in Java", "Bruce Eckel");
		Book b3 = new Book("Java: The Complete Reference",
						"Herbert Schildt");

		// Creating the list which contains the
		// no. of books.
		List<Book> book = new ArrayList<Book>();

		// Adding books to List object
		// using standard add() method
		book.add(b1);
		book.add(b2);
		book.add(b3);

		// Creating an object of class 2
		Library library = new Library(book);

		// Calling method of class 2 and storing list of
		// books in List Here List is declared of type
		// Books(user-defined)
		List<Book> books
			= library.getListOfBooksInLibrary();

		// Iterating over for each loop
		for (Book bk : books) {

			// Print and display the title and author of
			// books inside List object
			System.out.println("Title : " + bk.title
							+ " and "
							+ " Author : " + bk.author);
		}
	}
}
