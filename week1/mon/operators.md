# Operators in Java

## 1. Arithmetic Operators 
They are used to perform simple arithmetic operations on primitive 
data types.

* `*`: Multiplication
* `/` : Division
* `%` : Modulo
* `+` : Addition
* `–` : Subtraction

### Unary Operators: 
Unary operators need only one operand. 
They are used to increment, decrement or negate a value.

* `–` : Unary minus, used for negating the values.
* `+ `: Unary plus indicates the positive value 
(numbers are positive without this, however). It performs an 
automatic conversion to int when the type of its operand is the 
byte, char, or short. This is called unary numeric promotion.
* `++` : Increment operator, used for incrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties of increment operators.
* `—` : Decrement operator, used for decrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties of decrement operators.
* `!` : Logical not operator, used for inverting a boolean value.

## Assignment Operator 
`=` Assignment operator is used to assign a value to any variable. 
It has a right to left associativity, i.e. value given on the 
right-hand side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the 
left, and therefore right-hand side value must be declared before 
using it or should be a constant.

The general format of the assignment operator is:

`variable = value;`
